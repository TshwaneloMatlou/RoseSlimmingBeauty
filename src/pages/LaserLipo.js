      <p className='p-2 m-2'>
        It is a cold laser light that is applied directly to the skin. 
        The laser light stimulates the fat cells to open up and release their “fat” contents; 
        this is equivalent to stored energy being used during exercise; 
        hence this is a stimulation of the natural process of the body using stored energy and is completely natural. 
        The “fat” contents are made up of water, glycerol and free fatty acids, 
        as they are released from the cell, the fat cell shrinks. This procedure is safe, no surgery, 
        its non invasive and best of all no “down” time after a treatment.
